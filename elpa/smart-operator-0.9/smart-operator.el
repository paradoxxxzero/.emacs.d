;;; Commentary:

;; This package can automatically add whitespaces before and after operators.
;; e.g, "=" becomes " = ", "+=" becomes " += ". which will be handy for
;; writing C-style sources.

;; To use, set all the operators smart at one time, then ajust some at
;; your wish e.g.
;;
;; (defun my-c-mode-common-hook()
;;   (smart-insert-operator-hook)
;;
;;   (local-unset-key (kbd "."))
;;   (local-unset-key (kbd ":"))
;;   (local-set-key (kbd "*") 'c-electric-star))
;;
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)

;; Besides `smart-insert-operator' when writing, there's also
;; `smart-beautify-operator' to beautify ugly codes, be careful there
;; are still some unresolved issues in `smart-beautify-operator'!

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'smart-operator)

;;; Todo:

;; - Some unresolved issues in `smart-beautify-operator', such as:
;;   printf("%s")
;; - Clean fun/var names with respect to package name

;;; Code:

(defvar smart-operator-alist
  '( "=" "<" ">" "%" "\\+" "-" "\\*" "/" "&" "|" "!" ":"))
